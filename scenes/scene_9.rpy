    "*The detective and PA regroup in the hallway*"
    pa "(crossing arms) So, what do you think? You buying his story?"
    mc "(pacing) I don't know. But something's off. The phone call, the music, the way he's reacting... it doesn't add up."
    pa "(sighing) You think he's telling the truth? That he didn't do it?"
    mc "(stopping) I think there's more to this than we're seeing. And I'm not ready to write him off just yet."
    pa "(smirking) You're gonna make this harder than it needs to be, aren't you?"
    mc "(half-smile) Wouldn't be the first time."
    pa "(nodding) Alright, fine. Where do we start?"
    mc "(determined) That pizza place. We need to find out who called him."
    pa "You really think a pizza ad is connected to this?"
    mc "I don’t know. But it’s the only lead we’ve got."
    "*They head out, the weight of the case hanging heavy in the air.*"
