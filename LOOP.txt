SCENE 22 – DRIVE
(MC is in his car, speeding through the rain-soaked streets. The city blurs around him as he races against time. The narrator’s voice sets the tone.)

Narrator:
"The address burned in his mind, a beacon in the storm. The detective raced through the night, each second ticking closer to disaster. Somewhere ahead, another life hung in the balance, and the clock was running out."

"But as the city lights flickered past, one question lingered—what would he find at the end of the road? A chance to stop the killer? Or another cruel twist in a game he didn’t fully understand?"

(Scene fades to black with the sound of a car engine roaring and rain pounding against the windshield.)

SCENE 22.1 – MC Arrives at the Crime Scene
(MC pulls up to a small house on a quiet street. The lights are on inside, and the front door is slightly ajar. He steps out of the car, gun drawn, and approaches the house.)

Narrator:
"The house stood silent, its windows glowing faintly in the night. The air was thick with tension, as if the walls themselves were holding their breath. Somewhere inside, the truth waited—or perhaps, another trap."

(MC barges into the house, gun raised. Inside, a family—a man, a woman, and a child—are sitting at the dinner table, startled by his sudden entrance.)

Man (standing up, alarmed): "Who the hell are you?!"
Woman (pulling the child close): "What do you want?!"
Child (scared): "Mom, I’m scared…"
Man (to MC): "Look, whatever’s going on, we don’t know anything, okay? Just leave us alone!"

MC (holding up his badge, breathing heavily): "Police! Where’s your phone?!"

Man (confused): "What? Our phone? It’s—it’s right there. What’s going on?"

(MC spots the phone on the wall, an old rotary model. He grabs it, his hands trembling. The family watches in stunned silence.)

Narrator:
"The room felt smaller now, the air heavier. The detective’s desperation was palpable, his every move fueled by a mix of fear and determination. But in his haste, he failed to notice the cracks in the facade—the signs that something was terribly wrong."

(As MC holds the phone, it suddenly rings, the sound piercing the silence. He hesitates for a moment before answering.)

MC (into the phone): "Who is this?!"

MP: "How many times will you fall for this, detective? You’re smarter than this… or are you?"

MP: "The clock’s ticking. How many lives will you lose before you figure it out?"

(The line goes dead. MC slams the phone down, his frustration boiling over.)

MC (to himself): "Damn it!"

(He turns to the family, who are now visibly frightened.)

Man (nervously): "What’s going on? Who was that?"
MC (ignoring him, muttering): "It’s not here. It’s not here…"

(He storms out of the house, leaving the family bewildered. The screen fades to black as the sound of rain intensifies.)

Loop Back to SCENE 21
(MC gets back into his car, gripping the steering wheel tightly. The narrator’s voice returns as the scene transitions back to SCENE 21.)

Narrator:
"And so, the chase continued. The detective was caught in a spiral, each step forward pulling him deeper into the maze. The caller was always one step ahead, always just out of reach. But the detective couldn’t stop. Not now. Not when the truth was so close."

(Scene fades back to SCENE 21, with MC once again chasing the shadowy figure into the darkness.)
